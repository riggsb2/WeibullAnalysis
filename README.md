Work down to automate the Weibull analysis that I did by had for my 
dissertation.

Input:
1. A text file with the first number as the thickness in microns and any 
number of subsequent entries interpretted as voltages.

Handling:
1. Extract the thickness and voltages from the data
2. Calculate the breakdown fields.
3. Conduct a Weibull analysis finding the scale and shape parameters
4. Construct a Weibull Distribution for the data set.

Output- A pdf report that includes
1. A table of the thickness, voltage, and breakdown fields
2. The Weibull plot including regression line and a table of Weibull 
parameters
3. A Weibull distribution for the data.
